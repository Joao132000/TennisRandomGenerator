This software predicts the result of a tennis tournament based on each player UTR(Universal Tennis Rating)

Players with higher UTR has higher chances of winnig the match but it does not guarantee the win, the lower UTR player still has a chance...

The software also adjusts the players UTRs between matches, depending on the results.

So, the code outputs different results evertime it is executed, example below:
